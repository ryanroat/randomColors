# randomColors
this project uses native css variables to manipulate the DOM to change the background color, text color and border color of a div/box

numerical color value is randomly generated in javascript as a decimal and converted to a string hex code

error capture to insure hex code string contains six characters, then converted to uppercase and hex hash '#'
prepended prior to display on screen

added javascript code from - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12043187/how-to-check-if-hex-color-is-too-black - 
to evaluate brightness/luminosity of background color and adjust text and border color css variables to accommodate
